# Potato Disease Classification

The Potato Disease Classification project aims to develop an efficient model using `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)` and `TensorFlow` to accurately identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants. The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the early detection of diseases, thereby `contributing to more effective crop management and increased agricultural productivity`.
